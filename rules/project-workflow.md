# Project Workflow Conventions

## Language

Always respond in **Chinese (中文)** when executing project-workflow commands. All generated files (CLAUDE.md, PROGRESS.md, docs/architecture.md, docs/plan.md, module CLAUDE.md) must also be written in Chinese. Technical terms (e.g., CLAUDE.md, Plan Mode, MVP, Mermaid) keep their English form.

## Status Lifecycle

Module status MUST use exactly these three values:

```
未开始 → 方案已确认 → 已完成
```

- **未开始**: Module has not been planned yet
- **方案已确认**: Implementation plan is written to `docs/plan.md` and confirmed by the user
- **已完成**: Module is implemented, tested, committed

Do NOT use other status values (e.g., "进行中", "开发中", "待测试").

## File Responsibilities

| File | Nature | Content | Update Frequency |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Static config | Project overview, tech stack, module list, coding conventions | Rarely (new conventions or common mistakes only) |
| `PROGRESS.md` | Dynamic progress | Module status table, next entry point, milestones | Every session end |
| `docs/architecture.md` | Persistent design | System diagrams, data models, module boundaries, design decisions | When architecture changes |
| `docs/plan.md` | Temporary plan | Current module's implementation plan (overwritten per module) | Each `/module-plan` run |
| `[tier]/CLAUDE.md` | Static config (tier) | Tier-specific tech stack, build/test commands, coding conventions (multi-tier projects only) | Rarely |

**Key rule**: Never put progress/status info into `CLAUDE.md`. Never put coding conventions into `PROGRESS.md`. Keep static and dynamic separate.

**Tier-level CLAUDE.md (multi-tier projects only)**: When the root `CLAUDE.md` declares a "项目类型" section with a tier table, each listed tier directory contains its own `CLAUDE.md` (e.g., `backend/CLAUDE.md`, `frontend/CLAUDE.md`). These are L2 auto-loaded files — Claude loads them automatically when reading files in that tier directory. Tier-specific conventions (build commands, coding style, test commands) take precedence over root-level conventions when working within that tier. The tier table in root CLAUDE.md is the **single source of truth** for detecting whether the project is multi-tier and what the tier directories are.

## CLAUDE.md Constraints

- Target < 300 lines
- No module status or progress information
- Module list shows names and responsibilities only (no status)
- Detailed architecture goes in `docs/architecture.md`, not here

## Available Commands

- `/project-plan` — Full project planning: requirements, research, architecture, persist to project files
- `/module-plan` — Module planning: load context, explore code, design, persist to docs/plan.md
- `/module-dev` — Module implementation: load context, follow plan step by step, test key behaviors, verify against plan
- `/module-done` — Mark module complete: Code Review Gate (check uncommitted changes, suggest code review), update PROGRESS.md, optionally create module CLAUDE.md
- `/plan-review` — Read-only plan quality review: requirements coverage, architecture drift, interface consistency, dependency integrity
